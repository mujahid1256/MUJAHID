                <p><i>This is very subjective and, therefore, this essay is doomed to be personal and somewhat
                        opinionated.
                        I confine myself to problems that a programmer is very likely to have to face in her work. Many
                        of
                        these problems and their solutions are so general to the human condition that I will probably
                        seem
                        preachy. I hope in spite of this that this essay will be useful.</i> </p>
                <p class="dark">In this essay the term boss to refer to whomever gives you projects to do. I use the
                    words business,
                    company, and tribe, synonymously except that business connotes moneymaking, company connotes the
                    modern workplace and tribe is generally the people you share loyalty with. </p>
